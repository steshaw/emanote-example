# emanote-example

An example GitHub Pages website built with https://github.com/srid/emanote.

## Using emanote-template

1. [x] Change `index.yaml` to use your site's title (and set the same in `index.md`)
2. [x] Change `.deploy/github/index.yaml` to change the `baseUrl` (if your repository is named differently or you are using a CNAME). If you are using CNAME (with no sub-path), then you may get rid of the `.deploy/github` layer entirely (be sure to update `publish.yaml` accordingly).
